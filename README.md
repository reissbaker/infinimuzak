## Converting existing MIDI files to JSON

Use the [ToneJS MIDI converter](https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/). Note that even
if you modify the exported JSON on the ToneJS site, their preview site won't
take your edits into account! They just play the MIDI directly and make the
exported JSON available to copy/paste. The only way to listen to your edits is
by using the infinimuzak UI in this repo.
